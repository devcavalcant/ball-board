**Ball Board** is a simple page written in React for creating balls within your screen, with a create, return and reset function. This is a project to test the learning acquired in React, the focus is on being a simple and functional application, so it's an environment for study.

## About

The project was done entirely in react + vite + typescript, so just by getting **node.js** you can already use and test the project. The system consists of a simple screen, with a header that groups together all the board's functionalities and other features. The board is just a black, fully clickable screen. Each time the user clicks on the board, a new circle appears on the screen, so you can draw or test other functions.
